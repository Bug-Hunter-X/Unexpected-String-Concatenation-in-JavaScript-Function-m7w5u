This repository demonstrates a common error in JavaScript involving unexpected string concatenation when adding a number and a string. The `foo` function is intended to add two numbers, but due to JavaScript's type coercion, it concatenates the string '5' to the number 5 instead of performing numerical addition.  The solution demonstrates how to prevent this by explicitly converting the input to numbers using `parseInt()` or `Number()`. This is a crucial consideration for handling user input or data from external sources to prevent unexpected behavior.
